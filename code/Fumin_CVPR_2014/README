Title: 

Is sparse representation based face recognition really interesting? 

Is Sparse representation or collaborative representation really interesting in face recognition? 

On the importance of encoding in face recognition



To do:

1. Is it possible to train a linear exemplar-SVM using only 1 positive
   training image per class for classification? If that works, we can
   claim ``face recognition with 1 training image per class''. 
 --- Yes, we can. Refer to the results.doc.

2. We need to know the impact of patch size; and pooling. How do they
   contribute to the final classification performance? Yi Ma and all
   others' methods don't have pooling at all. It is possible that
   pooling improves a lot as in the generic image classification.

3. If we look at the soft-thresholding equation in Page 4 of Coates
   and Ng's ICML paper, the learned dictionary is nothing but a set of
   image filters. When random noises (R in the ICML paper) are used as
   the dictionary, it's the same as applying random projection, taking
   a nonlinear max operation (which is very important because it
   introduces nonlinearity) and then train a linear classifier. I'd
   guess in theory, this set of linear image filters can be many other
   formats such as Gabor filters.
