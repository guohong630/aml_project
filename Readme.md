- stock price prediction


Meeting Memo
----------

##Feb 8

###work done:
- Topic: financial prediction
- routine: improve based on reference projects

###task in comming week:
read reference projects and find out:
- what data? 
    - price or RoE? 
    - size?
    - accessible?
- what model?
    - liner-regression
    - svm
    - ann ...
- what trick?
    - deal with time-correlation? compared to image processing (receptive field?)
    - using any tech index?
- how to present result, any benchmark?

###issues to discuss with TA or instructor: 
- language
- external packages
- grading criteria
- due date

## Feb 15

###Work Done:

Papers Review I:
- Goal: to study and apply as many Machine Learning Algorithms as possible on a dataset for stock market
- Assumption: EMH
- Methods: Fundamental vs Technical

- what model:
 - Support Vector Machines
 - Linear Regression
 - Decision Stumps
 - Expert Weighting (Assume a best expert?? or WMA??)
 - Online Learning (SVM online? )
 - Boosting??

- what data?
 - prices on EMA
 - only two companies
 - downloaded from the yahoo finance section.

- what feature?
 - date + price

- what trick?
 - deal with time-correlation? use EMA
 - using any tech index? EMA
 - Boosting + SVM

- how to present result, any benchmark?
 - EMA as comparision?  binary

 Papers Review II:
- Assumption: EMH
- Methods: Fundamental vs Technical
- Goal:
  - The project will concentrate on building an automated trading platform which would con- sume web services and have a database back-end
  - research AI techniques involving ANNs and genetic algorithms to forecast financial time series data.
  - investigate the applicability of different neural networks architectures to forecast currency exchange rates movements on Forex market.


### To do:
- Read paper II and compare with paper I for implemenations
- schedual meeting with Instructor on Thursday
